				<p> People around me usually called me Phet ( Means diamond in Thai ). I was born as raised in Bangkok, Thailand. I completed
					my primary education in <a href="https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/Dawn+International+School/@9.982961,76.395793,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3b080b3211bf5db7:0x4f3a743d49e85dec!8m2!3d9.982961!4d76.397987">Kerala, India</a>.
					And now I am currently pursuing my final year in Bachelor of Science degree in Software Engieering at <a target="_blank"
					    href="http://www.mfu.ac.th/home.html">
					Mae Fah Luang University</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.co.th/maps/@20.0461135,99.890778,16z">
						Chiang Rai, Thailand</a>.</p>

					I'm not exactly sure how I was introduced into the world of programming, but I know that I have completely fell in love with
					it. If I wasn't to be a programmer, I guess I would selling noodles or a farmer ( Seriously ). I always love to keep
					updating on new technologies. I'm now into the world of web development, but who knows where I might be in the future.
				</p>
				<p> Aside from programming - running, football, reading, photography and playing games ( Mostly strategy games ) are what
					I usually do to relax myself during my free hours. I started running when I decide quit almost 6 years of smoking and
					I realised that I wasn't that good at football, lol. I can fluently read, write and speak both English and Thai ( Although,
					I'm not the best at writing ). I wish that, one day I would try hard enough to learn Chinese ( Although, I hate linguistics
					).

				<span class="image main"><img src="images/whatido.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>When I first entered the world of programming I was mainly focused on Java. I hadn't realised where would I stand in
					the world of programming until I went for a summer internship ( 06/2017 - 07/2017 ) at G-able TechSphere Co., Ltd. (
					G-able ). I am currently in love ( or maybe some kind of love-hate relationship ) with JavaScript and what it could
					possibly do. Ionic and Angular are what I often used in most of my works. I am currently learning ReactJS as well as
					its brother React Native. However, I am also interested in iOS mobile application development as I am an iPhone as well
					as Mac user ( Yep, I'm an Apple fanboy ). </p>

				<p>With all that said, I know that I do a lot of things as I am the person with many interests. But to be honest I'm not
					the nest in either things. I'm still figuring out a clear career path, I know that my heart is with programming it is
					just the matter of where in programming.</p>

					<li>Java ( Spring MVC, Spring Boot )</li>
